我最近回去看了大學做的專題，覺得過去有些統計內容沒什麼統計意義，像是這個：

在性別方面與等待時間做交叉列表和卡方檢定

卡方檢定的假設：

H0：等待時間和性別獨立

Ha：等待時間和性別不獨立

即便顧客願意等待的時間與性別不獨立，假如女姓願意等比較久，店家也不可能由於此便先做男性的餐點，我覺得這對店家是沒什麼意義的資訊。

所以我想以目前所學的專業，再做一次大學專題看看。

---------------

I recently revisited my university project and felt that some of the statistical content I used in the past didn't have much statistical significance, such as this:

Creating a cross-tabulation and conducting a chi-square test between gender and waiting time.

The hypotheses for the chi-square test:

H0: Waiting time is independent of gender.

Ha: Waiting time is not independent of gender.

Even if the waiting time customers are willing to endure is not independent of gender, for instance, if females are willing to wait longer, it's not practical for a restaurant to prioritize male customers' orders based on this. I think this information is not particularly useful for the business.

So, with the knowledge I have now, I want to remake my university project to see the difference.
