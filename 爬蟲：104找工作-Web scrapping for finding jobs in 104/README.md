我發現104好像不能隱藏已經看過或不想應徵的工作，只能隱藏某種產業，導致我一直看到重複的工作，找工作變得相當沒效率，於是就寫了這個爬蟲

參考網址：

除了網址的內容，還加上了：

• 職缺網址連結

• 可篩選不要應徵的公司與職缺關鍵字

• 同樣的職缺即便網址改變，也不會再出現

• 可爬完104所有頁數

• 可搜尋多個關鍵字

• 匯出Excel

I noticed that on the 104 job site, it seems impossible to hide jobs that I have already seen or am not interested in applying for; I can only hide certain industries. This leads to repeatedly seeing the same job listings, making job searching quite inefficient. Therefore, I wrote this web crawler.

In addition to the content of the URL, I also added:

• Links to job vacancy websites.

• Filters to exclude companies and job keywords I don't want to apply for.

• The same job listing will not reappear, even if its posting date is updated.

• Ability to crawl all pages on 104.

• Capability to search for multiple keywords.

• Export to Excel.
